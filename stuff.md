# The World

For many eons, Astiavar had two moons, one large and one small. TODO name 'em.

During the Elarian Upheval, the moons' orbits aligned. In fact, the moons passed close enough for the small one's orbit to be dramatically altered, amd it grew and grew in the sky until it one day glanced off Astiavar's upper atmosphere and careened into space. Needless to say, there was chaos among the civilizations of the planet, even those relatively unaffected by the Upheval.

Fun times.
