# The World

Called Astiavar.

### Moons

For many eons, Astiavar had two moons, one large and one small. TODO name 'em.

During the Elarian Upheval, the moons' orbits aligned. In fact, the moons passed close enough for the small one's orbit to be dramatically altered, amd it grew and grew in the sky until it one day glanced off Astiavar's upper atmosphere and careened into space. Needless to say, there was chaos among the civilizations of the planet, even those relatively unaffected by the Upheval.

Fun times.


# Elarion

Country. eh-LAH-ree-ohn

Demonym: Elarian (eh-LAH-ree-an)

Capital: Rost Elarion (RAHST)

Rost Elarion was first a city of a large nation (TODO name it). The nation fell with its capital to a neighboring country, but numerous cities, Rost Elarion included, held out as independent city-states and later claimed surrounding lands to become full-fledged nations of their own.

In the following decades, Elarion emerged as the dominant survivor of the collapse and before long was in possession of the full splendor of (whatever we call the dead one).

A golden age followed. Elarion, by then a kingdom, absorbed its neighbors and grew. Trade flourished. Backed by the state, the wizarding academy and the University were frequently making discoveries and rediscoveries in science and magic. Literacy spread to the common folk, and peace was upon the land.
